This package provides a PHPUnit extension that helps reproduce flaky tests by seeding the random number generator with a consistent value across test runs. This allows you to reproduce and debug flaky tests more easily.

## Compatibility

This package is compatible with the following versions of PHP and PHPUnit:
- **PHP :** `^8.1 || ^8.2 || ^8.3 || ^8.4`
- **PHPUnit :** `^10.0 || ^11.0 || ^12.0`

It has been tested with the following versions of popular tools that wrap PHPUnit:
- **Paratest :** `^7.0`
- **Pest :** `^2.0 || ^3.0 || ^4.0` (this package includes a Pest Plugin for improved compatibility)

It is compatible with any tool that uses `mt_rand()` for randomness in tests, such as [Faker](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker).

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev patricksamson/phpunit-flaky-fix
```

You'll then need to register the extension in your `phpunit.xml` file:

```diff
 <phpunit
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit.xsd"
     bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
 >
+    <extensions>
+        <bootstrap class="PatrickSamson\PHPUnitFlakyFix\FlakyFixExtension" />
+    </extensions>
     <testsuites>
         <testsuite name="unit">
             <directory>tests/Unit/</directory>
         </testsuite>
     </testsuites>
 </phpunit>
```

## Usage

When you have bootstrapped the extension, you can run your tests as usual:

```sh
vendor/bin/phpunit
php artisan test
php artisan test --parallel
```

The generated `Flaky Test Seed` will be one of the first lines in the output, and you can use it to reproduce flaky test failures.

```console
vendor/bin/phpunit --colors=always

Flaky Test Seed: 2031556362. To reproduce, run `FLAKY_SEED=2031556362 php artisan test --filter ...`

PHPUnit 12.3.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

Runtime:       PHP 8.4.10
Configuration: /home/runner/work/phpunit-flaky-fix/phpunit-flaky-fix/phpunit.xml

...........                                                       11 / 11 (100%)

Time: 00:00.003, Memory: 14.00 MB

OK (11 tests, 35 assertions)
```
## How It Works

The extension works by:

1. Generating a new, completely random seed at the start of your test suite execution, and displaying it in the output
2. Seeding PHP's random number generator (`mt_rand()`) with this value, before `setUp()` is called for each test

This ensures that your tests remain deterministic and reproducible, while still allowing for randomness between different test suite runs.
To reproduce a flaky test failure, simply re-run that specific test with the provided seed.

In practice, there is some additional complexity to ensure compatibility with parallel test execution and other PHPUnit features.

## Limitations

1. This extension only affects PHP's `mt_rand()` function and related randomness functions
2. It is not compatible with [`random_int()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-int.php) as it can't be seeded.
3. It has no effect on time-based functions (e.g., `time()`, `date()`, ...), but that can be remediated using something like `Carbon::setTestNow($knownDate)`
4. It does not control randomness from other sources (e.g., database auto-increment values, UUID generation, external API calls, ...)
5. The seed is generated per test suite run, not per individual test
6. Some PHPUnit features or third-party tools might interfere with the seed generation process or the output display
